This isn't meant to be groundbreaking, just a place for me to practice and learn. I am just learning python for my classes, and I wanted a place to practice my coding using tools I found on the internet and to just practice what I was already taught.  This is my ongoing project, adding, updating, fixing, reworking parts with new skills I have picked up.
